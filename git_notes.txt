How to merge individual commits from another branch into your branch ("mybranch"):

`git stash`
`git checkout other-user-name/other-branch-name`
`git log --oneline` (this gives you all the recent commits)
`git checkout mybranch`
`git cherry-pick commit_1 ... commit_n`
Troubleshooting:
  * If it is a pull request, you can do `git cherry-pick -m 1 commit#`
  * If there are conflicts, resolve by hand and then commit
  * If you need to bail, `git cherry-pick --abort`
`git push origin mybranch`
